  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level,<br>
  interpreted programming language. It is a language which is also characterized<br>
  as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.<br></p>

 <p>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of<br>
 the World Wide Web.[citation needed] It is used to make dynamic webpages<br>
 interactive and provide online programs, including video games. The majority<br>
 of websites employ it[citation needed], and all modern web browsers support<br>
 it without the need for plug-ins by means of a built-in JavaScript engine.<br>
 Each of the many JavaScript engines represent a different implementation of JavaScript,<br>
 all based on the ECMAScript specification, with some engines not supporting<br>
 the spec fully, and with many engines supporting additional features beyond ECMA.<br></p>
